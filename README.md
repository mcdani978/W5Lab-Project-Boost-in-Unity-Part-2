# W5Lab-Project-Boost-in-Unity-Part-

Summary - From the video lessons, I learned how to make my game more interactive and fun. One of the key things I did was refine the player controls. I improved how the player moves and rotates, so it feels smoother when they boost or change direction. This made the game more enjoyable because the controls are easier to use, and everything feels more responsive.I also added more obstacles to the game to make it more challenging. These obstacles can be things like walls or other objects the player has to avoid. One cool feature I added is a transport sphere. When the player hits it, it moves them forward just a little bit. It’s not a huge change, but it’s fun and gives the player something to look forward to during the levels.Another thing I learned was how to add unique sound effects for different actions. For example, there’s a specific sound when the player hits an obstacle, and another when they use the transport sphere. This helps make the game more exciting and gives feedback to the player when something happens.I also got multiple scenes working correctly in the game, so when the player finishes one level, they automatically move on to the next one. It was a little tricky at first, but now it works smoothly, and the player can keep progressing through the game without any problems.Overall, I learned a lot from the video lessons, and even though I faced some challenges, I was able to overcome them by experimenting and testing my game. It’s been a fun experience, and I’m happy with the progress so far.
